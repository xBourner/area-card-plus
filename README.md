# Overview

An **Area Card** for your Home Assistant Dashboard

I always thought the area card has so much more potential so i made my own one. <br>
The card will show all entities/devices grouped into domains or device classes that are linked to your area. <br>
To make sure this card will work like it should please check if your relevant entities are assigned to the correct domain.

This card i highly influenced by [Dwains Dashboard](https://github.com/dwainscheeren/dwains-lovelace-dashboard). So now you can use this great idea as a single card in all of your Dashboards
